# radiation_calculation
This code organises data into a dictionary, calculates the average using a function, then calculates the standard deviation using another function. Finally, it prints out results for each location.

#  Project. Radiation Calculation
#  Using Loops for Data Processing, Data Organization and Average Calculation, using Nested Loops and Debugging.

Welcome to the Radiation Calculation project! This tool helps you to calculate various aspects of radiation exposure and related parameters.

## Features
• The Average and Standard Deviation Calculations: Calculate the average and standard deviation of radiation levels for multiple locations.
• Radiation Monitoring: Monitor radiation levels and assess potencial hazards in different environments.

## Technologies Used
• Python 3.12.2: Backend logic and calculation algorithms.
• SQLite: Database management for storing radiation data and user inputs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone 'https://github.com/rimag2023/radiation_calculation.git'


3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt (optional)
4. Run the application: 'Radiation Levels. Calculation.py'

## Usage 
bash
To run the Radiation Calculation project to help you to calculate various aspects of radiation exposure and related parameters.

## Example:

Location: City Centre
average Radiation:  24.00
Standard Deviation:  4.69

Location: Industrial Zone
average Radiation:  34.80
Standard Deviation:  3.54

Location: Residential District
average Radiation:  15.80
Standard Deviation:  2.86

Location: Rural Outskirts
average Radiation:  11.80
Standard Deviation:  3.31

Location: Downtown
average Radiation:  22.40
Standard Deviation:  2.87
